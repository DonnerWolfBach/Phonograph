this is an answer to here (since that was not the right place and I could not find other contact info): https://github.com/nextcloud/text/issues/593#issuecomment-2150593616

In a nutshell,  I have experience with onenote, logseq, standard notes and a little bit of joplin

joplin  I can recommend if you want something open source and straightforward

onenote if you want to collaborate with people who are already in the windows ecosystem or want to take handrawn notes in addition to other stuff

standard notes if you want high security (they have external reviews and with them joining proton their security should only get better)

logseq if you want features+open source. I have heard the "paradigm" it similar to org mode,  and I think logseq has some setting making it more similar to that -  but ultimately I have no experience with org mode

if you have more in depth questions feel free to ask (seby.stack@s-sch.net)

 also I would be interested to know how things worked out for you
